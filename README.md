# The-Real-Time-Determination-of-Numbers-of-Passengers
Since more and more people are gathering to metropolis like Shanghai, the burden on public transportation, especially subways and metros, is getting heavier and heavier. A common scene in metros is that some trains and carriages are overcrowded, while others are almost deserted. This inequality can cause not only passengersâ€™ discomfort, but also potential risks in operation. Our team found that both passengers and operation companies need one thing, real-time numbers of passengers in each carriage and train, so that they can make right decisions. Therefore, we decided to design a system to determine the real-time number of passengers in each carriage and each train, upload the real-time data onto the Internet, and provide a method (QR code) for everyone to achieve these data as conveniently as possible. To achieve the best accuracy and other functions, we make every effort on algorithm, mathematic principles and assemblage, etc. With two cameras to obtain the images, a computer (with Matlab) for image and data processing, the same computer for data transmission, a website to show real-time data and a QR code system to connect to the website, our whole system can meet our original demand. Also we meet with some problems and still have something to improve, but our system must have a good potential market and be welcomed by different stakeholders, passengers, operators, and people from all walks of life.
